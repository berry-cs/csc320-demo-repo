# Reading Questions - Section 5.4

1. At first glance, what is the best efficiency class one might expect to get for multiplying two *n*-digit numbers? 
In what year was a better approach discovered, and what is its time efficiency?


2. Note that if we use the regular matrix multiplication algorithm, $c_{00}=a_{00}b_{00}+a_{01}b_{10}$. Show that this is what we get when we compute $m_1+m_4-m_5+m_7$ by simplifying that expression (using the definitions of these given in the chapter).


3. Explain where the 7 A(n/2) comes from in the recurrence relation for A(n) on page 191. Explain where the 18 (n/2)2 comes from in the recurrence relation for A(n) on page 191.


4. What is the best you could possibly hope for for the worst-case complexity of an algorithm that multiplies two n√ó n matrices? Explain.
