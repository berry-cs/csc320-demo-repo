# Reading Questions - Section 5.2

1. Of mergesort and quicksort, one of them essentially does the work on the way down the recursive calls, and the other one does the work on the way back up from the recursive calls. Which is which? Clearly justify your answer.


2. What sorts of arrays does quicksort perform worst on? Why do those arrays make it perform badly?


3. Can the worst-case behavior of quicksort be prevented, or at least the chances of it occurring minimized? If so, explain how. (If you're fuzzy on an answer to this - post the question as an RFC.)


4. Which algorithm is considered the best sorting algorithm: quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort? Why?


5. Give two or three downsides of quicksort.
