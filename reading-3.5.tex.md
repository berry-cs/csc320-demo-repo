# Reading Questions - Section 3.5

1. The book talks about a stack when it discusses DFS, yet no stack is explicitly mentioned in the algorithm. So what are they talking about?

2. Why are back edges not encountered in BFS?

3. What do DFS and BFS have in common? That is, what is the purpose of both algorithms?

4. If you are going to implement DFS and/or BFS, is it better to use an adjacency matrix representation of the graph, or an adjacency list representation? Explain.

5. Choose either DFS or BFS and explain why the algorithm has complexity $Î˜(|V|+|E|)$. Hint: This one is more difficult than algorithms we have previously analyzed. It is not as easy as setting up and solving a recurrence relation. If you do that, it will over-estimate the complexity. Instead, talk through how the algorithm works to at a slightly higher level while still making sure you account for everything.
