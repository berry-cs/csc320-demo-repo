# Reading Questions - Section 3.3

1. What is the *Euclidean* distance between two points? Give both a technical definition and an explanation of what it represents.

2. Explain why the *sqrt* is unnecessary in `BruteForceClosestPair` algorithm, and why removing the *sqrt* is a good idea.

3. Is the convex hull of 3 points always a triangle? Explain.

4. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ distinct points. What are the possible sizes (in terms of *number of points*) of the convex hull of $S$?

5. How many extreme points does the set represented in Figure 3.5 (page 111) have?

6. Given the set of points $S=\{ (0,0), (1,1), (0.5, 2), (3,0), (0,3) \}$, do the computation described on page 112-113 to show that the line segment between (0,0) and (3,0) is on the convex hull of S.

7. Which points are on the convex hull of S in the previous question?
