# Reading Questions - Section 4.5

***You may skip reading the subsection on "The Game of Nim"***

1. Give a concrete example of an array of 8 elements representing a "best-case" input for *Quickselect*.


2. Give a concrete example of an array of 8 elements representing a "worst-case" input for *Quickselect*.


3. Demonstrate interpolation search for the number 62 in the list `[1, 3, 10, 14, 27, 35, 50, 67, 83, 100]`. Write down l, r, and x for every iteration and show your computation of x each time.


4. Provide an worst-case example for *interpolation search*.


5. Explain why binary search tree algorithms are generally *variable-size-decrease* instead of 
   *decrease-by-a-constant-factor* (i.e. decrease by a factor of 2).
