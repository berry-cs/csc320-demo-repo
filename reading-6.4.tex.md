# Reading Questions - Section 6.4

1. Are *heaps* and *priority queues* the same thing? Explain


2. What are the main three operations on a *priority queue*?


3. Generally speaking, an array implementation of a binary tree is not a good idea. Why not?


4. Explain what happens in each iteration of the for-loop in `HeapBottomUp`. In other words, explain *what* each iteration of the loop accomplishes and *how* it accomplishes it. Be as detailed as possible.


5. Why does the for-loop in `HeapBottomUp` go from ⌊n/2⌋ down to 1. Address both why it goes backwards and why it doesn't start at n. (Hint: what is different about nodes 1 through ⌊n/2⌋ versus nodes ⌊n/2⌋+1 through n?)


6. Heapsort is not as fast as quicksort. Thinking about how it works, can you see what heapsort does that might make it slower?
