# Reading Questions - Section 6.1

1. Describe how the *PresortMode* algorithm given on page 204 works. That is, describe what the algorithm is doing in (concise) paragraph form.


2. If I want to search for a single item in a list, does it make sense to sort the list and use binary search to find the element? Explain.


3. An algorithm of complexity $\Theta(n^3)$ exists to solve a certain problem. If I sort the input, I can use an algorithm that has complexity $\Theta(n^2)$. Is presorting worth it in this case? Clearly justify your answer.
