# Textbook Exercises - Week 9/10

- Section 11.1, #11 (page 394) (See the hint in the back of the book. Use one of 
  the problems in Table 11.1, and explain your reduction clearly.)


- Section 11.3, #7 (page 410)


- In Section 11.3, #9 (page 410), read the definitions of the *clique* 
  and *vertex cover* problems (i and ii), and then this reduction from
  clique to vertex cover:

  Describe the reductions, in both directions, between clique and vertex cover
  using pseudocode. That is, provide two algorithms written using pseudocode:
  one will solve clique(G, m) using vertex-cover(G, m) as a "helper function";
  and the other will solve vertex-cover(G, m) using clique(G, m) as a "helper
  function".


- Section 12.2, #6 (page 441)


- Describe an approximation algorithm for finding a *minimum vertex cover* 
  (a vertex cover with the smallest number of vertices) in a given graph.
  Use an idea similar to that of the source removal algorithm for the 
  transitive closure except start with an arbitrary edge of the graph.
  Try to describe the accuracy ratio of your algorithm?
