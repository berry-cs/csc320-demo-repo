# Reading Questions - Section 6.3

1. How are balanced search trees an example of the *transform-and-conquer* technique? 


2. Since rotations change the structure of a tree, it seems possible that rotating might cause a BST to not be a BST anymore. That is, the rotated version might violate the binary search tree property. Explain in detail why a BST remains a BST after a *right rotation* is performed. Make sure you make a complete argument that it is still a BST. Refer to Figure 6.4 on page 221 for the required notation (e.g. T1, etc.)

 
3. What's so great about AVL trees? 


4. What's **not** so great about AVL trees?


5. Let's make sure you understand how *2-3 trees* are supposed to work. Consider the tree on the right side of second row of Figure 6.8 on page 225 (the one that has (3,8) as the root and (4,5) as its middle child). How many key comparisons are needed to determine whether or not 7 is in the tree? Which key comparisons are performed?
