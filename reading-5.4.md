# Reading Questions - Section 5.4

1. At first glance, what is the best efficiency class one might expect to get for multiplying two *n*-digit numbers? 
In what year was a better approach discovered, and what is its time efficiency?


2. Note that if we use the regular matrix multiplication algorithm, <img src="svgs/3bc1bcbe3b90d537999f08ef23a0a570.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=149.42362874999998pt height=22.831056599999986pt/>. Show that this is what we get when we compute <img src="svgs/07dd7ce38498d3384b469adee54ed0c4.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=146.6819013pt height=19.1781018pt/> by simplifying that expression (using the definitions of these given in the chapter).


3. Explain where the 7 A(n/2) comes from in the recurrence relation for A(n) on page 191. Explain where the 18 (n/2)2 comes from in the recurrence relation for A(n) on page 191.


4. What is the best you could possibly hope for for the worst-case complexity of an algorithm that multiplies two n√ó n matrices? Explain.
