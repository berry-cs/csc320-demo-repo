- Alice wants to throw a party and she is trying to decide who to invite. She
  has n people to choose from, and she knows which pairs of these people
  know each other. She wants to invite as many people as possible, subject to
  two constraints:
  - For each guest, there should be at least five other guests that they already know.
  - For each guest, there should be at least five other guests that they donâ€™t already know.

  Describe and analyze an algorithm that computes the largest possible number
  of guests Alice can invite, given a list of *n* people and the list of pairs who
  know each other. Explain how/why your algorithm works.
