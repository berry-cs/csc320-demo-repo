# Reading Questions - Section 3.3

1. What is the *Euclidean* distance between two points? Give both a technical definition and an explanation of what it represents.

2. Explain why the *sqrt* is unnecessary in `BruteForceClosestPair` algorithm, and why removing the *sqrt* is a good idea.

3. Is the convex hull of 3 points always a triangle? Explain.

4. Let <img src="svgs/e257acd1ccbe7fcb654708f1a866bfe9.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=11.027402099999989pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> be a set of <img src="svgs/55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.86687624999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> distinct points. What are the possible sizes (in terms of *number of points*) of the convex hull of <img src="svgs/e257acd1ccbe7fcb654708f1a866bfe9.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=11.027402099999989pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>?

5. How many extreme points does the set represented in Figure 3.5 (page 111) have?

6. Given the set of points <img src="svgs/97a1085bd73332c3b9af0924720f4877.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=274.0410749999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>, do the computation described on page 112-113 to show that the line segment between (0,0) and (3,0) is on the convex hull of S.

7. Which points are on the convex hull of S in the previous question?
