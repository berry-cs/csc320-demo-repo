# Reading Questions - Section 3.4

1. What's the good news about exhaustive search algorithms? (Give two pieces of good news.)


2. What's the bad news about exhaustive search algorithms?


3. Does anybody currently know a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the *Traveling Salesman Problem* or the *Knapsack Problem*? Explain how you know.


4. Which exhaustive search algorithm is more efficient, the one for the *Knapsack Problem* or the one for the *Assignment Problem*? Explain. (Note: It is a little silly to compare the efficiencies of algorithms that solve different problems, but the point here is to review your understanding of the growth rates of functions.)


5. Choose the best word in the following sentence and explain why it is the correct choice:
> If a problem domain grows exponentially or faster (e.g. a problem of size n has 2n or n! possible solutions) it is **always/sometimes/never** possible to find a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem.
