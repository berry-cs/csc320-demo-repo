# Reading Questions - Section 6.1

1. Describe how the *PresortMode* algorithm given on page 204 works. That is, describe what the algorithm is doing in (concise) paragraph form.


2. If I want to search for a single item in a list, does it make sense to sort the list and use binary search to find the element? Explain.


3. An algorithm of complexity <img src="svgs/3286dca1e85ee4b6f9b9bc1457937d59.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=42.81220349999999pt height=26.76175259999998pt/> exists to solve a certain problem. If I sort the input, I can use an algorithm that has complexity <img src="svgs/7f673488709d91c2cf326d97e5a437c3.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=42.81220349999999pt height=26.76175259999998pt/>. Is presorting worth it in this case? Clearly justify your answer.
